## Reporting Bugs ##

While we try to be diligent about fixing bugs as they arise, some problems may still not be addressed. To search for existing issues, please check our [user forum](http://groups.google.com/group/alt_predictions) and our [issue tracking system](http://code.google.com/p/altanalyze/issues/list). Many questions can also addressed by searching our [Wiki](http://code.google.com/p/altanalyze/w/list).

For new issues, in your report please include:

1) Your Operating System (e.g. Windows Vista, OSX 10.6, 64bit, etc.)

2) The version of the AltAnalyze program (e.g., 1.15), database you are using (e.g., Mus Musculus EnsMart55) and platform/array type (e.g., Affymetrix Exon 1.0, TopHat BED files).

3) Detailed information about the bug, including the exact circumstances that caused it and any error message that appears. Usually this is contained within a log file contained in the designated results output directory (AltAnalyze\_report.log) or in the AltAnalyze program directory.
